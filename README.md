# Astro-Photo

Super lightweight and scrapy static app built on Astro.
JSX-like syntax, compiles fully to HTML at build-time, leaving zero JavaScript.

The inherant pitfall being: the quirks of my first time using Astro.
I've been wanting to take a stab at it for a couple weeks and the moment felt appropriate in the scope of the No-JS topic. No so smooth stylisticly speaking.
